 * Additional Terms And Conditions.
 *
 * 1. Conditions
 * The purchase of a license for a component from Custom Swing Components entitles you to the following: 
 *   1.1. You may use the component on as many projects as you desire. There are no restrictions regarding the number of deployments, and you may bundle the component as part of your software, be it commercial or personal.
 *   1.2. Once you have purchased a component, there is no limit on how many times you may download the Java archive or its supporting documentation.
 *   1.3. 3 months free email support for the purchased component. Additional support will require the purchase of an extended support contract.
 *   1.4. Receive bug fixes and updates for the version of the component purchased. Note that this only includes increments of the component's minor version. To illustrate this, if you purchase version 1.0 of a specific component, you are entitled to all future minor updates (i.e. 1.1, 1.2 ... 1.n).
 *   1.5. In the event that a major version is released within 3 months of you purchasing the previous version, you will be automatically entitled to the new version. To illustrate this, if you purchase version 1.0 of a specific component, you are entitled to version 2.0 for free, if version 2.0 is released within 3 months of your purchase of version 1.0.
 *
 * 2. Restrictions
 * Restrictions apply to all types of licenses:
 *   2.1. You may not directly resell licensed component to other individuals or entities. To illustrate this, you may not sell the Java archive to third parties. Please note that this does not restrict you from including the component in commercial software; it prevents you directly selling the archive to other third parties.
 *   2.2. If the deployment of your software directly exposes the API of the component to third party developers, there may be an additional deployment fee. To illustrate this, if you sell a product whose primary target is developers, they will gain access to the licensed component and be able to use it in their own software. Please note that this does not restrict you from including the component in commercial software; it is intended to prevent other third party developers from making use of components that they have not purchased.
 *   2.3. A license may not be automatically transferred. An enterprise license is granted to a named enterprise and may not be transferred to another enterprise. A developer license is granted to a named developer and may not be transferred to another developer. Custom Swing Components does not support a floating license. Please contact us directly if you need to transfer a license.
 *
 * 3. License Types
 * At present there are 3 types of licenses available: developer, enterprise and source code.
 *   3.1. A developer license entitles a single named developer to make use of the licensed components.
 *   3.2. An enterprise license entitles all developers within the enterprise to make use of the licensed components.
 *   3.3. A source code license is available and applies on an enterprise scale; please contact us for more details.
 *
 * If you have additional questions regarding the licensing, please feel free to contact us directly.
